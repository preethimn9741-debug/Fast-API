# FastAPI 

## Project Overview
This project is a **simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) backend API** built using **FastAPI**.
It is created as a **learning and practice project** to understand how to build REST APIs, connect to a database, and handle backend logic using Python.

This repository is **not a production application**.  
It is intended for **learning, experimentation, and demonstration purposes**.

---

## Purpose of the Project
- Learn FastAPI fundamentals
- Practice REST API development
- Understand database integration using SQLAlchemy
- Explore request validation using Pydantic
- Get hands-on experience with backend architecture

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic
- **API Documentation:** Swagger UI
- **Server:** Uvicorn

---

## Architecture Overview
- FastAPI handles HTTP requests and responses
- SQLAlchemy manages database operations
- PostgreSQL is used as the local database
- Pydantic validates request and response schemas
- Swagger UI provides interactive API documentation

## Installation Steps

1️ Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/<preethimn9741-debug>/Fast-API.git
   cd Fast-API
   
2️ Create a virtual environment

    python -m venv venv
       
3️ Activate the virtual environment

       venv\Scripts\activate
       
4️ Install dependencies

       pip install -r requirements.txt
       
5 Run the Application

    The API will start at:
    
        http://127.0.0.1:8000
        
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        
## How to Test the API

FastAPI provides built-in interactive documentation.

Open your browser

Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Use Swagger UI to test API endpoints

 ## Example API Endpoints

GET /products → Fetch all products

POST /products → Create a new product

PUT /products/{id} → Update a product

DELETE /products/{id} → Delete a product

## Dependencies Note

This project is purely backend-focused.

Node.js is NOT required

If package.json they can be safely removed

## Testing (Future Enhancement)

Automated tests can be added using:

pytest

httpx or fastapi.testclient

## Code Quality (Optional)

For better formatting and linting:

black – code formatter

flake8 – linter

## Conclusion

This project is a learning-focused FastAPI backend that demonstrates how to build and run a CRUD API using Python and PostgreSQL.
It is ideal for:

Beginners learning FastAPI
Backend practice
Interview demonstrations
